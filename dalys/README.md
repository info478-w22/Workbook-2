# Disability Adjusted Life Years

 In this workbook, you'll use R Markdown to create a report that explores how **different metrics** of disease burden tell **different stories** about the health burden of a country. The data included shows the **percentage of burden** attributable to each cause. For example, it shows the percentage of all Years of Life Lost attributable to Parkinson disease. Using charts and/or tables, you'll visualize the health burden in Colombia due to:

 - Deaths
 - Years of Life Lost (YLLs)
 - Years Lived with Disability (YLDs)
 - Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)

 You **also need to include** a comparison across burdens (_not shown_ in the `sample-report.html` file). Data was downloaded for all-ages, both-sexes in **Colombia** in 2015 through the [GBD Compare tool](http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/).

See the `sample-report.html` file for an example report. You're welcome to recreate it (making sure to **add** a comparison visualization), but it might be more interesting to show the data in different ways.
