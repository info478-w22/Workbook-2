# What disease was responsible for the most burden (for each metric)?
# Store the name of each *cause* in a variable

# Using prevalence and YLDs, calculate inferred disability weights
# Note: these are not actual weights used in the study


# Identify any "unreasonable" values and replace them as NA

# Create a histogram of the disability weights


# What are the ten highest disability weights? Store these in a variable


# Which diseases have more YLDs than YLLs (and ylls > 0)?

# How many times higher is the prevalence than the number of deaths?
# Show the ratio of prevalence to deaths (for these diseases) in a histogram

# Which disease has the most similar burden of YLLs and YLDs (where ylls > 0)?

# For each cause, compute how many cases would have to have to be avoided
# to equal 65 YLLs (the equivalent of one death of a ~25 year old)
